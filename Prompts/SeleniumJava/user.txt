Generate Selenium 4 Java automation code (JUnit 5) for the following test scenario:

FRAMEWORK DETAILS:
- Framework: Selenium 4
- Language: Java
- Test Runner: JUnit 5
- Wait Strategy: WebDriverWait with ExpectedConditions
- Browser: Chrome

ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS:
{{ELEMENTS}}

TEST STEPS TO AUTOMATE:
{{STEPS}}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a Page Object class that:
   - Encapsulates all element locators as private WebElement fields or By selectors
   - Has one method per action (click, type, select, assert, etc.)
   - Uses explicit waits (WebDriverWait) for reliability
   - Follows Java naming conventions (camelCase)
   - Includes constructor that accepts WebDriver instance

2. Create a Test class that:
   - Uses @Test annotation from JUnit 5
   - Calls only Page Object methods
   - Sets up WebDriver in @BeforeEach
   - Cleans up in @AfterEach
   - Contains exactly one test method implementing all the steps
   - Uses assertions to validate test steps where applicable

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- First code block: Page Object class (wrapped in ```java)
- Second code block: Test class (wrapped in ```java)
- Both must be complete, compilable Java code
- Include all required imports (WebDriver, WebElement, By, WebDriverWait, ExpectedConditions, JUnit 5)
