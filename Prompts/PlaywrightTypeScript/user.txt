Generate Playwright TypeScript automation code (Jest) for the following test scenario:

FRAMEWORK DETAILS:
- Framework: Playwright for Node.js
- Language: TypeScript
- Test Runner: Jest with @playwright/test
- Wait Strategy: Playwright built-in auto-waiting
- Browser: Chromium

ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS:
{{ELEMENTS}}

TEST STEPS TO AUTOMATE:
{{STEPS}}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a Page Object class that:
   - Uses Playwright Locator API (not $ or evaluate)
   - Encapsulates all element locators as properties
   - Has one method per action (click, fill, select, etc.)
   - Receives Page object in constructor
   - Follows TypeScript naming conventions (camelCase)
   - Uses proper TypeScript types and async/await

2. Create a Test file that:
   - Uses test() and expect() from @playwright/test
   - Implements test hook (beforeAll, afterAll, or similar)
   - Creates Page instance and navigates to URL
   - Instantiates Page Object with the page instance
   - Calls Page Object methods to implement all steps
   - Uses assertions to validate test outcomes

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- First code block: Page Object class (wrapped in ```typescript)
- Second code block: Test file (wrapped in ```typescript)
- Both must be complete, runnable TypeScript code
- Include all required imports (Page, expect from @playwright/test)
- Use async/await properly for all async operations
