Generate Selenium 4 C# automation code (NUnit 3) for the following test scenario:

FRAMEWORK DETAILS:
- Framework: Selenium 4
- Language: C#
- Test Runner: NUnit 3
- Wait Strategy: WebDriverWait with ExpectedConditions
- Browser: Chrome

ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS:
{{ELEMENTS}}

TEST STEPS TO AUTOMATE:
{{STEPS}}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a Page Object class that:
   - Encapsulates all element locators as IWebElement properties or By locators
   - Has one method per action (Click, Type, Select, Assert, etc.)
   - Uses explicit waits (WebDriverWait) for reliability
   - Follows C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public methods)
   - Includes constructor that accepts IWebDriver instance

2. Create a Test class that:
   - Uses [TestFixture] and [Test] attributes from NUnit 3
   - Calls only Page Object methods
   - Sets up WebDriver in [SetUp] method
   - Cleans up in [TearDown] method
   - Contains exactly one test method implementing all the steps
   - Uses Assert for validation where applicable

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- First code block: Page Object class (wrapped in ```csharp)
- Second code block: Test class (wrapped in ```csharp)
- Both must be complete, compilable C# code
- Include all required using statements (OpenQA.Selenium, OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome, NUnit.Framework, etc.)
