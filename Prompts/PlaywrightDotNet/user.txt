Generate Playwright .NET automation code (C# NUnit) for the following test scenario:

FRAMEWORK DETAILS:
- Framework: Playwright for .NET
- Language: C#
- Test Runner: NUnit 3
- Wait Strategy: Playwright built-in waits
- Browser: Chromium

ELEMENT SPECIFICATIONS:
{{ELEMENTS}}

TEST STEPS TO AUTOMATE:
{{STEPS}}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a Page Object class that:
   - Uses Playwright IPage Locator API
   - Encapsulates all element locators
   - Has one method per action (Click, Fill, Select, etc.)
   - Receives IPage in constructor
   - Follows C# naming conventions (PascalCase)
   - Uses async/await for all operations

2. Create a Test class that:
   - Uses [TestFixture] and [Test] attributes from NUnit 3
   - Implements [SetUp] and [TearDown] for browser lifecycle
   - Creates IPage instance and navigates to URL
   - Instantiates Page Object with the page instance
   - Calls Page Object methods to implement all steps
   - Uses Assert for validation

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- First code block: Page Object class (wrapped in ```csharp)
- Second code block: Test class (wrapped in ```csharp)
- Both must be complete, runnable C# code
- Include all required using statements (Microsoft.Playwright, NUnit.Framework, etc.)
- Use async/await properly for all async operations
